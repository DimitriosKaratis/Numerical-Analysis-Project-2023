# Numerical-Analysis-Project-2023
A Numerical Analysis project that I worked on during my years of study at AUTh.

In this project we were asked to implement different numerical analysis methods using Python's and jupyter notebook's help, to test their behavior under specific inputs, while also finding the errors each method produced. Finally, we had to plot and compare the different reuslts and answer certain questions.
The official instructions to the project are located in the "Project_Presentation_NA_2023.pdf" file, translated in english.
