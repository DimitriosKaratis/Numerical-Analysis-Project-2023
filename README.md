# Numerical-Analysis-Project-2023
A numerical analysis project that was assigned to me throughout the years of studing at AUTh.
In this project we were asked to implement different numerical analysis methods using Python's and jupyter notebook's help, to test their behavior under all kinds of inputs, while also finding the errors each method produced. Finally we had to plot and compare the different reuslts and answer certain questions.
